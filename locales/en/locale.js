    'text_1': 'Ogun Afrobeat is a Madrid-based musical project created by Nigerian drummer, percussionist and vocalist Akindiimeji Onasanya. He had two objectives in mind when putting this diverse ensemble of musicians together—to make people dance, and to broaden the genre’s horizons. Akin felt that the Spanish capital needed a solid reference to Afrobeat’s traditional canon, and what better way to do that than by paying homage to the immortal legacy of Fela Kuti? But he wanted to take things much further. Afrobeat’s strong African roots needed a more global flavor, incorporating experienced instrumentalists from multiple origins (Cuba, Spain, Colombia, Morocco, Italy) who enrich the sonic and aesthetic elements to produce a thoroughly international enterprise.',
    'text_2': 'As with any solid Afrobeat foundation, you will find elements of funk and jazz, but Ogun throws some neo soul and electronic music into the mix, too. When it comes to the band’s African foundation, the unmistakable Yoruba influences of fuji, juju music, and sakara are evident, along with some added touches from other regions of the mighty African continent, from Morocco and Senegal to Ethiopia, to name a few. It is a transgressive approach that makes for a fresh, daring result. This music is not content to settle for satisfying devotees of the genre. It pushes the boundaries of it to create an integrated, multicultural sound.',
    'text_2_2': 'Together, the members of Ogun Afrobeat have created a harmonious musical community that brings their diverse heritages together into a shared path with a common goal: to put people into a trance and make them dance. After all, that’s what Afrobeat is all about.',
